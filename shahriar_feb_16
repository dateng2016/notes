How much data do we have on Google Business?

A month or so.

Any idea on improving the model?

Try some new model or work on the existing one?



Can you show me the code on how you initially gathered all the training data? What was the time span?

carrier_count from carrier table
if fix_restaurant_id -> isMerchant else -> no (inside company_info)

order_within_.. -> order_info table
complete order history -> order_info_history (we need to get the sign up date and go from there )



How is going with data collection and storage? Can you show me the source code for those? Also the new APIs that you created for data collection.

analytics _ srevice repo -> db/daily_usage_track
analytics DB -> daily_useage_track


Walk me through how you gathered training data last time?
