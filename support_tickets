Hi Mr Shammo, the user from sales@ntouchmarketing.com has two webhooks linked. They are reporting that they are not receiving all statuses, the first one that they are receiving is order_assigned. They need to receive the oerder_inserted webhooks for those that are coming from Toast, EHungry and GloriaFood. They want to automate changes but are unable to because they are not receiving the webhooks.
No filtering and no rate limit on their end. They are sending them directly to Pipedream.
P.D: We would also like to be able to monitor the Webhooks sent with a new tool ~ Thank you for your time :)
