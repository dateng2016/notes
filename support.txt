three types -> 
1. poll orders from their platforms 

2. webhooks -> this use access token, main DB restaurant_mapping contains the access token mapping. fundamental issue -> orders not getting in.

todo -> check the recent orders in the order_info table to see if they are being inserted properly 

# issue 
1. whether an order was received in the first place. mongo DB -> external_order log

Data exchange means that we are missing  some values and fields which we need to call their APIs to poll extra data to fit our own structures.

In delete_history collection the content id is the order id.

For webhooks related things, we can check the order_update_log based on orderId, if it has "WEBHOOK_SEND" then everything on our end is good. The issue is not on our end.

We can also use the addition ID in the data to find if the order ixists√ß
