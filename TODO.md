Talk to Adem about the components on the status page

See if we can hide the incidents 

Work on the deprecated warning for the securityConfiguration.java



Hadi notes:

we fetch orders from the other sites like Shopify, Square, etc.

First explore their sites,

POLLING their orders, we call the API every interval, 
WEBHOOK -> We create an app in their place with secrets, we create a client at shopify, we will provide the endpoint to shopify. 

Map it to our order_info table


Ecommerce -> customer places the order themselves. 
PoS system -> Need a phone call or be present before hte cashier and tell the staff to create the order for them.
