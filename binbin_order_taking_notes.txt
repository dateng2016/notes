More details in the doc -> Especially on the flow of the retell webhook such as process user input, the lifecycle of the call session, etc.

Only 7 items in total?? Try more items to test the latency???


Download more things??? -> Check my download files.
heartland_menu_optimizer 
- 216 -> Why?
- 128 -> How is it sorted?
- 90 -> Rule type??
- 165 -> What's report category id?
- 174 -> Why extract keywords like this
- 195 -> Why only take first 150 chars

retell_webhook.py
- Too long...
- CallSession class -> Separate file
- verify_signature -> separate file
- display order -> separate
- html content -> separate file
- prompts -> separate (e.g. line 372) -> I think you already have it in a separate file? no need to duplicate?
- functions way too long
- 50 Why handle order submission at call ended event? -> What if submission fails and customer does not know?
- 377 -> get menu should be depreceated??? Moved to retell???
- 417 -> one field at a time?? -> Meaning?
- 422 -> How to know if `item_name` is invalid?
- Any reason to separate the developer prompt from the system prompt? -> Right now I think you are submitting dev prompt each time there is a user input?? Maybe not necessary???
- 232 What is `continue_dish`??
- `process_user_input` needs to be broken into chunks -> 
- 237 -> break down the for loop
- 241 -> `get_menu_items()` only has dummy data???
- 257 -> current_item_asked_optional -> Meaning?
- 332 -> should the processing validated items be delegated to a background thread instead?? 
- 349 -> Might be misusing the developer message (minor issue)
- Does the process_user_input function handle multiple items at once??
- 181 -> Make it more structured (Define a class) to better track the content of the attributes.
- 880 -> Does the submission of the order happen during or after the phone call???
- 671, 807, 879, many places to submit the order????
- 940, 968 -> Why validating again here, no validation during the finalize_order phase???
- 707, 518, why different source of customer info?? metadata vs
- 1015 -> should better name this, confusion around finalized vs. submitted...
- 880 -> Break down the method, I'm getting lost in all the nested try/except blocks, don't make it so nested, hard to track.



my_open_ai.py

- 44 -> validate_items_backend -> break this into chunks
- validate_items_backend can do multiple items at a time???
- 89 -> Also using dummy data for ITEM_NAMES? Is this what was used during testing? -> Will latency be really long if use actual menu???
- 49-60 -> Define some classes to better visualize how the content of the dict looks like?? also the meaning of each field
- 109 -> REQUIRED_TOPLEVEL this is also a dummy variable???
- 183 -> Break it down from there, choose better variable names to identify where they come from. avoid `vals`, hard to tell the difference between `mods` vs `item_mods` get lost after long number of lines of code. use something like mod_from_user or mod_from_menu. 
- 196 -> Why should their be duplicates?
- 253 -> Cut down the modification without user consent???
- 512 -> What is that for?
- 517 -> No difference between the 2 branches??
- 527 -> Same as above??
- 


OrderProcessor.py
- 63 -> append instead of = ????
- 108 -> If it's in the compelted items, does that not GUARANTEE the validity?
- 283 284 -> Avoid using Dict[str, List[str]] ... Very hard to track what's inside. I had to go to the function defined for schema for open AI usage. Not very readable...
- 300 309 -> Why should this be possible to happen, is this not guaranteed to be valid during the validate_backend ???
- 313 -> modifier_data, item_modifiers, modifiers_by_category, these names do not really indicate well what's inside, easy to get mixed up. 
- 223 -> Validate again at final phase???
