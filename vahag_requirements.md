Here is what I need for the "Growth Dashboard" inside our CRM

1. Three Tables by AE
   The dashboard should be divided into sections for each AE (Mark, Nicals, Alejandro, etc.).
   Each AE section should display a table of leads specific to the countries they manage.

   Instead right now we are doing a filter by REGIONS
2. Lead Status Dropdown
   Similar to existing “Select Agent” or “Priority” dropdowns, I’d like a Status dropdown with the following options (with color coding if possible):
   New (grey)
   Already Assigned to Sales (grey)
   Closed - Lost (red)
   Closed - Won (green)
   Contacted - Needs Follow-Up (yellow)
   Demo Scheduled (yellow)
   Unresponsive (red)
3. Table Data
   In addition to Signup Date, I need:
   Upgrade Date
   Signup to Upgrade Duration (in days)
4. Filters for Signup to Upgrade Duration
   I’d like to filter by the following time ranges:
   1 day
   2–7 days
   7–14 days
   14–30 days
5. Filters for Upgrade Date
   Upgrade Date should have date-based filters:
   Today
   Yesterday
   This Week
   Last Week
   This Month
   Last Month
6. Additional Metrics (if possible)
   It would be very helpful to add:
   MRR / ARR columns
   A column for whether the plan is Monthly or Annual
   Let me know if any of this needs clarification or if something isn’t feasible.

This would help with:
the two way communication and daily/weekly follow up with the team
Monitoring lead quality and source effectiveness

Let's also try to have a total number of each AE for the same time windows we can select and total number all AE numbers combined.
Thanks!
